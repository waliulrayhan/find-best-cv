# Training Results & Core Files Summary

## ‚úÖ Results After Anti-Overfitting Changes

### Latest Training (Oct 29, 2025):
- **Final Test Accuracy**: 84.18%
- **Cross-validation**: 84.18% ¬± 2.33%
- **F1 Score**: 0.8342
- **Early Stopping**: Epoch 25 (instead of 34+)
- **Best Validation Accuracy**: 84.68% (Epoch 25)
- **Status**: Moderate overfitting (improved from severe)

### Key Improvement:
‚úÖ Stopped training before severe overfitting  
‚úÖ Consistent performance across folds  
‚úÖ Better generalization than before

## Problem Identified (Previous)
Model showed severe overfitting:
- Training loss: 3.18 ‚Üí 0.0148 (too low)
- Validation loss: 1.19 ‚Üí 3.30 (increasing)
- Best epoch was 7-8, but training continued to epoch 34

## Changes Applied to `config/config.py`

### 1. Early Stopping (Reduced Patience)
```python
"patience": 5,  # Changed from 10
```
**Effect**: Stops training sooner when validation stops improving

### 2. Increased Dropout Rates
```python
BERT_CONFIG["dropout"]: 0.4,  # Changed from 0.3
LSTM_CONFIG["dropout"]: 0.4,  # Changed from 0.3
HYBRID_CONFIG["final_dropout"]: 0.3,  # Changed from 0.2
```
**Effect**: Stronger regularization, prevents memorization

### 3. Stronger L2 Regularization
```python
TRAINING_CONFIG["weight_decay"]: 0.05,  # Changed from 0.01
```
**Effect**: Penalizes large weights, improves generalization

## Expected Results
- Training stops around Epoch 10-15 (instead of 34+)
- Better validation accuracy: 87-90% (up from 82%)
- Smaller train/val loss gap
- Faster training: 2-3 hours saved

## Next Steps to Improve Further

### Option 1: Freeze BERT (If still overfitting)
Edit `config/config.py`:
```python
BERT_CONFIG = {
    ...
    "freeze_bert": True,  # Change to True
    ...
}
```
Reduces trainable parameters from 156M ‚Üí ~10M

### Option 2: Add Data Augmentation
Implement text augmentation (synonym replacement, back translation) to increase effective dataset size.

### Option 3: Ensemble Learning
Train 5 models with different seeds and average predictions for higher accuracy.

## Usage

### Test Changes
```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Visualize Training
```bash
python analyze_training.py
```
