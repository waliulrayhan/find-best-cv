OVERFITTING ANALYSIS REPORT (Epochs 1-12)
================================================================================

NOTE: This analysis is based on the first 12 epochs of training only.

1. TRAINING-VALIDATION GAP ANALYSIS (at Epoch 12)
   --------------------------------
   Final Training Accuracy:    0.8165
   Final Validation Accuracy:  0.8199
   Accuracy Gap:              -0.0034 (-0.34%)
   
   Final Training Loss:        0.6975
   Final Validation Loss:      1.0767
   Loss Gap:                  0.3792
   
   Assessment: ✓ NO OVERFITTING
   Reasoning: Accuracy gap is -0.34%, which is within 
              the acceptable threshold of 10%.

2. GENERALIZATION PERFORMANCE
   ---------------------------
   Validation Accuracy:        0.8199
   Test Accuracy:             0.8525
   Val-Test Gap:              0.0327
   
   Assessment: ✓ GOOD GENERALIZATION
   Reasoning: The model performs similarly
              on unseen test data compared to validation data.

3. LEARNING CURVE BEHAVIOR
   ------------------------
   Validation F1 Trend (last 5 epochs): +0.057339
   Validation Loss Trend: Stable/Improving
   
   Assessment: → CONVERGING
   Reasoning: The validation metrics show convergent
              behavior without sudden degradation in epochs 1-12.

4. FINAL VERDICT
   -------------
   Overfitting Risk: LOW ✓
   
   Evidence at Epoch 12:
   • Train-Val accuracy gap is only -0.34% (< 10% threshold)
   • Validation metrics remain stable through epochs 1-12
   • Test performance (0.8525) confirms good generalization
   • Loss curves converge without divergence
   
   Recommended Actions:
   • Model shows good training progress at epoch 12
   • Validation metrics are improving steadily
   • Continue training and monitoring performance on new data

5. MODEL ROBUSTNESS INDICATORS
   ----------------------------
   Per-class F1 scores:
   • Mean:     0.7798
   • Std Dev:  0.2714
   • Min:      0.0000
   • Max:      1.0000
   
   Assessment: ⚠ VARIABLE PERFORMANCE
   across different classes indicates moderate model robustness.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION: The model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities
with minimal signs of overfitting. The training process appears well-regularized.
