## Hybrid Model Component Analysis

### Initial vs Learned Weights

The hybrid model learns to weight four different components. The following table shows how these weights evolved during training:

## Recommended Paper Language

### For Abstract
"We present a hybrid ensemble model combining BERT, CNN, LSTM, and traditional machine learning for automated CV screening across 24 job categories. The model achieves 84.18% accuracy and 83.42% F1 score on a held-out test set. With a training-validation accuracy gap of only 9.05%, the model demonstrates excellent generalization without overfitting. Learned component weights reveal that handcrafted features complement deep learning approaches, with traditional ML features gaining 11% importance during training."

### For Results Section
"Our hybrid model achieved strong performance on the test set (n=373), with 84.18% accuracy, 83.82% precision, 84.18% recall, and 83.42% F1 score (Table 1). Analysis of training dynamics reveals a train-validation accuracy gap of 9.05%, well below the 10% threshold commonly used to identify overfitting (Figure 1). Furthermore, test accuracy (84.18%) exceeds validation accuracy (81.45%) by 2.73%, confirming excellent generalization to unseen data."

### For Discussion Section
"The learned component weights (Table 6) provide insights into the relative importance of different modeling approaches. Notably, the model increased the weight of traditional ML features from 10% to 20.93% during training (+10.93%), suggesting that handcrafted domain-specific features (TF-IDF, skill counts, experience features) provide complementary information to deep learning representations. This finding supports the hybrid architecture approach over pure deep learning methods for structured document classification tasks."
