- Final F1: 80.68% validation

**Use in paper:** Results section, optimization discussion

---

### Figure 8: Model Convergence
**Why:** Multiple convergence indicators
- (a) Loss improvement per epoch
- (b) Metric stability (rolling std)
- (c) Cumulative accuracy gain
- (d) Loss moving average
- Proves stable, non-divergent learning

**Use in paper:** Results section, training analysis

---

### Figure 9: Overall Performance Summary ⭐ CRITICAL
**Why:** Comprehensive performance dashboard
- (a) Overall metrics bar chart
- (b) F1 distribution histogram
- (c) Box plots of P/R/F1
- (d) Radar chart of performance
- Single figure summarizes everything

**Use in paper:** Abstract, introduction, main results
